# Food Delivery and Restaurant Ordering System (Angular + TypeScript)

This project is a single-page web application for browsing restaurants, viewing menus, placing food orders, and tracking delivery status. It is built with Angular and TypeScript and uses a mock backend (JSON files or JSON Server) for restaurant, menu, and order data.

## Project Status

- Planning and scaffolding phase.
- Angular workspace and app shell not yet created.

## Key Features (Planned)

- Restaurant listing with ratings, cuisine types, and filters.
- Menu view for a selected restaurant with item details and categories.
- Shopping cart to add, update, and remove items.
- Checkout flow with delivery details and payment options (simulated).
- Order status page to track placed orders.
- Responsive UI using Angular Material.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Angular (v17 or later)
- Language: TypeScript
- UI Library: Angular Material
- Tooling: Node.js, Angular CLI, JSON Server or static JSON files

## Getting Started

> Note: The Angular project structure will be created in a later task. These steps describe how the project will be used once the Angular app is generated.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)
- Angular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)

## Setup (Planned)

1. Install dependencies:
   - npm install
     > **Note:** The project structure was generated manually. Run `npm install` to download required packages.
2. Run the development server:
   - ng serve
3. Open the app in a browser at:
   - [Port 4200](http://localhost:4200/)

## Mock Backend (Planned)

- Use JSON Server or static JSON files to provide restaurant, menu, and order data.
- Define sample data under a mock-data folder or similar.
